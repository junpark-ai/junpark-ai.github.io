Hi, I am a research intern in [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab (RCV)](https://sites.google.com/view/rcvuos/home) in UOS, advised by [Prof. Jiyoung Jung](https://sites.google.com/view/rcvuos/Members/professor-personal-page?authuser=0).

Now I'm interested in robotics and I'm actively studying. In the future, I would like to research the application of computer vision, reinforcement learning and LLMs in robotics. In particular, I would like to use NVIDIA Isaac Gym for my research.<br/><br/>

> ### Korea Expressway Corporation Complaint Classification
>
> There were so many complaints for the company, so a lot of time was used for categorizing the region department. So we used deep learning to classify the region of the complaints.

>### Generate abbreviations for memorization
>
>In childhood, when we had to memorize some words for the exam, we would make a special word with the first character of the words. For example, when we have to memorize '부산', '서귀포' and '진천', we can make a word '부서진' for an abbreviation. We thought that it's not so easy to make abbreviations when the given words get bigger, so we trained a model to make abbreviations for given words.

>### JMT : Korean Typo Correction based on JaMo-unit Tokenization
>
>Unlike English, Korean characters are composed of 2-3 letters. So there can be many more combinations of typos in Korean than in English, and we cannot store all the typo words in our model's vocabulary. So, we used "Jamo" unit tokenization. We used transformer for our model, and the performance was better than other tokenizations.

> ### Proxy initialization for Deep Metric Learning
>
> In deep metric learning, it is important to minimize intra-class variation while maximizing inter-class variation. There are many methods to deal with this problem, but I concentrated on initializing the proxy for each class. I found some interesting parts of initialization (e.g. initialize proxy for the mean of their classes), but unfortunately it couldn't beat the SOTA method.

> ### AICOSS Hackathon Competetion
>
> We participated in a competition to develop an AI model that performs Multi-Label Classification based on satellite images containing various geographic and environmental features. We tried various models and losses, and we could get the 1st prize in the competition. And also I could get skills in multi-GPU training.
